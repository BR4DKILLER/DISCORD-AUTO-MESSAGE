# DISCORD AUTO MESSAGE (HELP)












If you want to grab your token then follow these steps:

- you must login to discord on your browser
- open the developer console in your browser
- enter the following code (CONFIRMED TO WORK ON CHROME/EDGE/OPERA/FIREFOX):
```
copy((webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[''],{},e=>{m=[];for(let c in e.c)m.push(e.c[c])}]),m).find(m=>m?.exports?.default?.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken())
```
- your token is now copied to your clipboard.
